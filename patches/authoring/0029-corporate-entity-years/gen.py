"""Emit 0029-corporate-entity-years.yaml from the curated ROWS below.

Companion to the hand-written 0013-corporate-entity-years.yaml, extending
corporate-entity active years to twelve more significant makers that were still
missing them. Same shape as 0013: attribution `flipcommons-catalog`, each row
guarded on `ipdb_manufacturer_id` and cited to a seeded web root (Wikipedia,
created in 0012-citation-sources-web.yaml).

No pinexplore/classify.py stage here: unlike the 0010 game_format work (which
classifies IPDB/OPDB free text in DuckDB), the evidence is Wikipedia article
prose gathered by web research. So the classification lives as ROWS literals in
this file; gen.py emits worksheet.csv as the audit artifact and reads the live
flipcommons DB only for the `expect:` guards and a drift check.

Run from the backend so Django can read live guard values:
  cd flipcommons/backend && \
    uv run python ../../pindata/patches/authoring/0029-corporate-entity-years/gen.py
