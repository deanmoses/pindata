"""Emit 0030-em-firm-years.yaml — corporate-entity years for four early Chicago-era
firms (Genco, Exhibit Supply, J. H. Keeney, Stoner) that 0029 left unset because
they have no English Wikipedia article.

Casting a wider net (per the data-notes follow-up): two are covered by Wikipedia's
"List of pinball manufacturers" (an already-seeded en.wikipedia.org page); the
other two need new citation roots, which this patch creates in its own `sources:`
block (the same mechanism 0012 used) — American Jukebox History for Keeney and the
Aurora Historical Society for Stoner.

Each maker is a single entry with one cite (one source supports both its years):
no per-field cite split was needed. patchkit.write_patch can't emit a `sources:`
block, so this generator composes the file itself — patchkit.entry() for the
escaped/guarded claim blocks, a literal header + sources prologue around them.

Run from the backend so Django can read live guard values:
  cd flipcommons/backend && \
    uv run python ../../pindata/patches/authoring/0030-em-firm-years/gen.py
