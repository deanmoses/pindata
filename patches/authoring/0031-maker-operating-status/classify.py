"""Editorial classification for patch 0031 — corporate-entity operating_status
(+ model-level cleanup fixes). Frozen human judgment as data.

`gen.py` reads each row, pulls the verbatim quote from the pinexplore web cache
(by `cache_url`, matching on `needle`, or a `quote` override) and the live
`expect:` guard from the flipcommons DB, then emits the patch via patchkit.

Recency rule (per review): an `ongoing` verdict needs a 2023-or-newer source
showing current production; `ended` is permanent so any dated source is fine.
Web sources are fetched once into the pinexplore cache (docs/WebCache.md); we
cite the primary URL (archive permalinks are a separate base-system concern).

Each ROW dict:
  slug      corporate-entity (or model, for GAME_FORMAT) public_id
  field     'operating_status' | 'game_format'
  value     the claim value
  source    human source name for the note ('<source> says "<quote>"')
  cite      what goes in cite: (a URL, or a scheme like 'opdb:2153')
  cache_url page in the web cache to quote from (defaults to cite when a URL)
  needle    unique substring of the evidence sentence (re-extracted live)
  quote     OPTIONAL verbatim override when the page has no clean sentence
  reason    editorial note (README / audit)
