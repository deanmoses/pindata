"""Worksheet generator: positively label pitch-and-bat / shuffle / bagatelle.

Patch 0010 labeled game_format only for the models IPDB *self-flags* "not a
pinball". Real pitch-and-bat bat-games, shuffle alleys and antique bagatelles are
catalogued by IPDB WITHOUT that disclaimer, so 0010 left them null. This patch
(0011) assigns those three formats off a POSITIVE IPDB signal: a sentence in the
game's own notes that names the mechanism AND is about THIS game.

The editorial judgment is frozen as the INCLUDE dict below: ipdb_id -> (format,
needle). The quote is re-extracted live as the sentence containing `needle`, so
it stays faithful to the current IPDB text; the needle must also appear in that
sentence's format keyword (asserted), guarding against a quote that names the
mechanism for a *different* game (the cross-reference trap).

Reads explore.duckdb, joins to flipcommons `models` (so only catalogued games
count), excludes every ipdb_id 0010 already labeled, and writes worksheet.csv.
No YAML here; that is gen.py (a second step, backend-side).
