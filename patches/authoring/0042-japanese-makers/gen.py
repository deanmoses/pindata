"""Emit 0042-japanese-maker-years.yaml — assert production years on early-Japanese
models flipcommons carries with a null or placeholder (1900) year.

Years come from the eremeka catalog (thetastates.com) and its companion blog
(earlyarcadesjapan.blogspot.com), seeded as citation roots in 0041. We derive the
structured `year` field from that research, so the attribution is flipcommons-catalog
with a cite to the eremeka page (the blog post where one exists, else the tag
listing). All seven models carry an IPDB id, so we guard on ipdb_id — the most
specific guard, present even where year is null.

Approximate eremeka dates (marked ~) are asserted with the uncertainty recorded in
the note, since the model has no "approximate" flag (per the authoring decision:
assert, note approximate).

Run from the backend so Django can read live guard values:
  cd flipcommons/backend && \
    uv run python ../../pindata/patches/authoring/0042-japanese-makers/gen.py
