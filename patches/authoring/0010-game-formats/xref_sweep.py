"""Sweep IPDB notes for cross-references that call ANOTHER named game not-a-pinball.

The own-note signal (ipdb_non_pinball_signals.explicit_not_pinball) only sees a
game's own Notes. But entries frequently say things like
"Williams' 1981 'Hyperball' ... is Not A Pinball" inside a DIFFERENT game's note.
This finds those, resolves the quoted title to a flipcommons model, and reports
ones not already labeled by the own-note worksheet.
