"""Worksheet generator: classify IPDB 'not a pinball' models into game formats.

Reads explore.duckdb, takes every model IPDB self-labels "not a pinball"
(ipdb_non_pinball_signals.explicit_not_pinball) that is present in flipcommons
(models.ipdb_id), and for each extracts the verbatim IPDB sentence that names
what the game actually is. Format is assigned from that verbatim prose; rows
with no positive device-type phrase fall to the 'miscellaneous' catch-all
(cited to IPDB's verbatim 'not a pinball' wording).

Output: worksheet.csv (auditable worksheet) + a summary.
No YAML is emitted here; that is a second step after review.

# False positives in the explicit_not_pinball signal. Two mechanisms:
#  - Cross-reference: the "not a pinball" phrase is about a *different* game named in
#    the text. Af-Tor/Chicago Cubs call THEMSELVES "the first/second pinball machine
#    with alphanumeric displays" (the phrase is about Williams' Hyperball); New Crazy
#    15's phrase is about a sibling game "Pop Up".
#  - Negation: the note DECLINES to call it non-pinball. Chuck-O-Luck (511) - "it
#    does have pins, pinballs, and a ball shooter, therefore we did not classify it
#    as Not A Pinball" - is a pinball/pachinko-like that IPDB explicitly kept.
